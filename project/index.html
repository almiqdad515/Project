                <ol>
                    <li>Gaza had basic but functioning infrastructure, including housing, schools, hospitals, and utilities.
                    </li>
                    <li>Gaza's economy was struggling due to a blockade, high unemployment rates, and limited resources.
                        However, there was still some economic activity with local businesses and agriculture.</li>
                    <li>Healthcare facilities were operational but under-resourced. There were challenges in accessing
                        advanced medical care and medicines.</li>
                    <li>Educational institutions were functioning, though they faced issues such as overcrowding and limited
                        resources.</li>
                    </ol>

                <h2>after the war</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Wars and conflicts have resulted in significant destruction of infrastructure. Many homes, schools,
                        and hospitals have been damaged or destroyed, leading to a housing crisis and inadequate medical
                        facilities.
                    </li>
                    <li>The economy has worsened significantly. Many businesses have been destroyed, unemployment has
                        increased, and there are severe shortages of essential goods and services.</li>
                    <li>Healthcare infrastructure has been heavily damaged. There is a critical shortage of medical
                        supplies, and the capacity to treat patients, especially those with war-related injuries, is
                        severely limited.</li>
                    <li>Many schools have been damaged or destroyed, disrupting education for thousands of children. The
                        trauma of conflict also affects the ability of students to learn and teachers to teach.</li>
